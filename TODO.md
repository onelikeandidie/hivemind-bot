I want the display module to be a different app instead. This app should serve
an api in a simple http server. The server would then serve the requests for
information on the bots and the messages.

Doing it like this would be better since I want to create an app to handle the
chat, the donations, the follows and everything like that. But I want these two
to be independent from eachother. Almost like a microservice architecture.

After moving that it is due for a refactor! I hate my own code!!!!!
